Hey! I'm Dex, a data science enthusiast that codes primarily in Python. As an undergraduate, I studied Neuroscience and was premed. However, I was captivated by the capabilities of machine learning and decided to leave medical school in order to pursue a career in health technology. Following college, I studied Mathematics at Columbia University and Data Science at General Assembly. I aim to help innovate and optimize the medical industry through the advancement of technology. I firmly believe machine learning has the potential to rid the world of many diseases and save millions of lives.

title: Billboard Hot 100
--- 

The dataset we are going to explore is the Billboard's Top 100, a list of the most popular songs in America. Our purpose for this project is to analyze the data and see which factors made major hits and stayed at the top of the charts the longest. The underlying question of this is: Why do we like what we like? Are there specific genres the public prefers? Does release date matter? We will examine and attempt to answer these questions.

**Problem Statement**

What makes a song that the public will love? From genre to length of song, there are many factors that can go into what the general public enjoys. Although these rankings are numeric, the preference for songs is subjective to different individuals. Not everyone agrees that the top Billboard songs are the best. Therefore, it is important to take these rankings with a grain of salt.

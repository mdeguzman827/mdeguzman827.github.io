title: Recognizing Digits
--- 

This is the very popular Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) Dataset. This data is widely considered as the "Hello World" of image recognition. For humans, it's quite easy to recognize digits written by other humans. However, for a computer, it's much more difficult since not ever written digit looks the same. Sometime a '2' can look a lot like a '3'. Let's see if we can correctly classify human written digits!

## The Data

The data has already been properly scaled and normalized, so there is almost no data cleaning required. Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel with a total of 784 pixels. The digits are numbers from 0 through 9, so a total of 10 digits. Excellent predictions achieve an error of less than 1%. 

## Procedure

We will use a deep learning library called Keras.

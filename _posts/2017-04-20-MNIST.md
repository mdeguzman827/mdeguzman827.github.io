title: Recognizing Digits
--- 

This is the very popular Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology (MNIST) Dataset. This data is widely considered as the "Hello World" of image recognition. For humans, it's quite easy to recognize digits written by other humans. However, for a computer, it's much more difficult since not every written digit looks the same. Sometimes a '2' can look a lot like a '3'. Let's see if we can correctly classify human written digits!

## The Data

The data has already been properly scaled and normalized, so there is almost no data cleaning required. Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel with a total of 784 pixels. The digits are numbers from 0 through 9, so a total of 10 digits. There are a total of 47,000 digits in the dataset. Excellent predictions achieve an error of less than 1%. Below are examples of the hand written digits.

## Procedure

We will use a deep learning library called Keras. Keras already has the MNIST dataset built in so it is very convenient. Since the digits are originally a 28 by 28 pixel
